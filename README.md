##  1. Project Title
**IUAIYUUU â€” Minimalist Personal Portfolio Website**

---

## ðŸªž 2. Project Description
This project is a **static landing page portfolio website** that reflects my identity and design philosophy.  
It combines technical precision with emotional storytelling â€” inspired by IUâ€™s elegance and human warmth.

The main goal of this project is to showcase how **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** can assist in developing  
a personal brand through empathetic, human-centered design.  

The concept **IUAIYUUU** represents:
- **IU** â†’ warmth, empathy, and creativity (inspired by singer Lee Ji-eun).  
- **AI** â†’ intelligence, logic, and modern digital transformation.  
- **YUUU** â†’ myself, as the human in between â€” connecting art and technology.  

The website was developed with a minimalist aesthetic, soft lilac tones, and smooth fade-in animations  
to create a calm, reflective user experience.
